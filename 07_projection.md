# MongoDB Projection and Embedded Documents

In MongoDB, projection allows you to specify which fields should be returned in query results. When dealing with embedded documents (documents nested within other documents), understanding how projection works becomes crucial for retrieving the desired data efficiently.

## Projection Basics

### Including Specific Fields

To include specific fields in query results, use the field names in the projection object with a value of `1`.
```json
db.collection.find({}, { field1: 1, field2: 1 })
```

### Excluding Specific Fields

To exclude specific fields from query results, use the field names with a value of `0`.
```json
db.collection.find({}, { fieldToExclude: 0 })
```

### Including Fields in Embedded Documents

When dealing with embedded documents, specify the path to the embedded field using dot notation.
```json
db.collection.find({}, { "embeddedDoc.field1": 1 })
```

### Excluding Fields in Embedded Documents

Exclude fields within embedded documents similarly using dot notation.
```json
db.collection.find({}, { "embeddedDoc.fieldToExclude": 0 })
```

## Examples

### Including Specific Fields Example

#### Include `name` and `age` fields from documents:
```json
db.collection.find({}, { name: 1, age: 1 })
```

### Excluding Specific Fields Example

#### Exclude the `password` field from documents:
```json
db.collection.find({}, { password: 0 })
```

### Including Fields in Embedded Documents Example

#### Include the `address.street` field from embedded documents:
```json
db.collection.find({}, { "address.street": 1 })
```

### Excluding Fields in Embedded Documents Example

#### Exclude the `address.zipCode` field from embedded documents:
```json
db.collection.find({}, { "address.zipCode": 0 })
```

### Query by a Field in an Embedded Document

Consider a `users` collection where each document contains an embedded `address` document:

```js
{
  "_id": ObjectId("60d5768f4cfa93d57f19a8e2"),
  "username": "john_doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "address": {
    "street": "123 Main St",
    "city": "New York",
    "state": "NY",
    "zipcode": "10001"
  }
}
```



#### Find users who live in New York:
```json
db.users.find({ "address.city": "New York" })
```


## Considerations

- **Impact on Performance**: Projection can significantly reduce the amount of data transferred over the network and improve query performance, especially when dealing with large embedded documents.
  
- **Dot Notation**: Use dot notation carefully to specify fields within nested structures to ensure accurate projection results.
